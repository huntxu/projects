Fi-ki, is a program used to type with a DDR pad, or of course, though less
exciting, with a joystick.

Fi-ki, stands for the combination of "feet" & "keyboard". It works in the 
way listening joystick events and generating keyboard events accordingly.

Install Fi-Ki with the following steps(in the source code directory):
    1. gcc fiki.c -o ./fiki
    2. chown root:root ./fiki
    3. chmod a+s ./fiki
    4. start with: ./fiki -j JOYSTICK_DEVICE -k KEYBOARD_DEVICE
    5. end with: ./fiki -K
